## Installation

Follow these basic steps to get the project ready. You don't need to run `npm install` if you will be using Docker.

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tnware/cloudflare-ddns-gui.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd cloudflare-ddns-gui

# Install dependencies
# Skip this step for Docker only
npm install
```

Next, create a file .env in the project root.

There is a provided .env.example, so you can just rename that and fill in your details.

If you do not have a Cloudflare API key, please [create one](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).

```bash
# .env
SECRET_CLOUDFLARE_AUTH="Bearer auth_token_here"
SECRET_CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL="name@example.com"
```

Now you can run the app or start developing.
